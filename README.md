Icon Kolan
==========

Or "sticky icon", is an Android widget mimicking standard launch icons,
which can survive cycles of uninstallations and installations. Thus, if you have such scenarios (developers, testers),
you can still keep the icon around for quick use.

The Icon Kolan launch icons are actually widgets that you will have to drop in your regular launcher interface.

* Clicking launches the configured application (if currently installed).
* Double-clicking opens the configuration panel.
